# HighCapacityBlockchain
An effort towards one of initial objectives.

# Future directions

Since October 2018, the possible immediate requirement for bringing this work further, no longer exists.

To develop this further, it is required to seriously work on section 1.1 and 1.2, probably with incremental proof generation ideas from the article “Scalable zero knowledge via cycles of elliptic curves” mentioned in references.

For the increased performance I have two ideas; 1- Generating part of proof which could be independently produced on separate nodes and scaling the solution by adding nodes. 2- Implementing the algorithm in hardware for example using FPGAs in first step; this could specifically be used for the incremental proof generation part
